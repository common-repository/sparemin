SpareMin is a voice conversation platform.

== Description ==

SpareMin is a voice conversation platform.

No more giving out your phone or email to strangers and endless emails coordinating awkward calls.  Now only connect when you have spare time and have calls that you can publish on social media.  We are bringing the intimacy and authenticity of a 1:1 phone call to the power of broadcast in today's social networks.

This plugin allows you to easily promote your sparemin handle and calls on your site.  You can place the shortcode or widget wherever you feel most appropriate.  You can simply add the recording url to any post/page and it will automatically create the SpareMin player object for you (just like YouTube does for videos).  You can also the add the widget for calling you anywhere you would like - the about, contact, and sidebars are all good locations for it.

== Installation ==

*   Install and activate SpareMin like any other plugin.
*   For adding the SpareMin contact me box, use the [sparemin] shortcode, or widget.
*   For adding recordings to your posts, just add the URL and it will automatically create the player.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the shortcode? =
The SpareMin shortcode takes four parameters:
float: left, right or none.
id: your SpareMin handle
message: your message
style: light or dark

An example of using the shortcode: [sparemin float="left" id="SpareMinCallBot" message="Call me" style="light"]

= How do I add a recording to my site? =

Just add the full URL.  An example would be adding the link "https://www.sparemin.com/myrecording/2613".
It should autopopulate with the player.
